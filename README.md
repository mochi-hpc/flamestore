What is FlameStore?
===================

FlameStore is a Mochi component to access Keras deep learning models
and store them in various backends (right now: in memory, on a local
file system, or on a composition of SDSKV and BAKE providers).

FlameStore is developped by Matthieu Dorier (mdorier@anl.gov).
More information on how to install and use is available
[here](https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/sds/flamestore/wikis/home).
